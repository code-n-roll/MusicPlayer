    Say, hey!

    Hear the sound of the falling rain
    Coming down like an Armageddon flame
    The shame
    The ones who died without a name

    Hear the dogs howling out of key
    To a hymn called "Faith and Misery"
    And plead, the company lost the war today

    I beg to dream and differ
    from the hollow lies
    This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
    On holiday

    Hear the drum pounding out of time
    Another protester has crossed the line
    To find the money's on the other side

    Can I get another Amen? (Amen!)
    There's a flag wrapped around a score of men
    A gag, a plastic bag on a monument

    I beg to dream and differ
    from the hollow lies
    This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
    On holiday

    Hey!
    Say, hey!

    "The representative from California has the floor"

    Sieg Heil* to the president Gasman
    Bombs away is your punishment
    Pulverize the Eiffel towers
    Who criticize your government
    Bang bang goes the broken glass and
    Kill all the fags that don't agree
    Triumph by fires, setting fire
    Is not a way that's meant for me
    Just cause, just cause, because we're outlaws yeah!

    I beg to dream and differ
    from the hollow lies
    This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
    I beg to dream and differ
    from the hollow lies
    This is the dawning of the rest of our lives

    This is our lives on holiday
